## Installation

```
$ npm install -g react-native-svg-cli
```


## How to Use


1. Open https://www.flaticon.com/
2. Search for your desired icon and click on it
3. On the search bar look for the icon's FQN:  https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/github-social-logo_9310
4. Copy that name (Ex. github-social-logo_9310) 

![][cli-demo-webpage]


### Then run the cli with either option below:

```
$ rn-svg-cli search -n name -f filename -o outputDir
```
Note: Flags can be ommited, but order should be respected:  
 ```$ (Example) rn-svg-cli search github-social-logo_9310 githublogo assets/icons```  
  
    
### Or you could use:

```
$ rn-svg-cli search
```

With the later, you will be asked the next set of questions:  
  
* Whats the name of the Icon (Ex. **github-social-logo_9310**): 
* What name should the new file have (we will append .icon.js):  
* Where should we save the new file (default assets/icons):

## And... voil√†, success! You now have your react-native compatible SVG ready to be used:


```javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { GithubLogoIcon } from 'assets/icons';

export default class CustomComponent extends Component {

	render() {
		return(
			<GithubLogoIcon width={50} height={50} />
		);
	}

}
```
